0the poor actors  0you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  0if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance  0this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  0if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made  1the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  1regrettably the film fails  0the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very

solid casting here  1all things considered a job very well done  1thanks good a movie like this was done and released  1one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  1it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  1the attention given to every

of melville  1everything about this film is simply incredible  1you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  1black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its

script which was worse  0camerawork  again bad  0rating 1 out of 10  0an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  1kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  1he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  1his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  1three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen  1and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  1i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  1i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  1i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  110 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  1i literally vomited while watching this film  0i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls  1his performance as awarded was stunning  1the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  1in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  1all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast  1im translating movies

they thinking  0lots of holes in the script  0its like a bad two hour tv movie  0now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  0the dialogue is atrocious  0the acting is beyond abysmal  0everything stinks  0trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  0worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  0its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  0in short dont bother with this movie  0i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  1the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it  1if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  1the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame  1a film not easily forgotten  1but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  1the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  1the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  1highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  1great movie  1also the story and acting were weak  0at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left

sucks  0this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  0this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  0a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  0avoid at any and all costs  0at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  0avoid this film at all costs  0i dont know what happened in season five what a mess  0the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  0now this is a movie i really dislike  0its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  0the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks  0the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  0there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  0i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs  0the fact is this

here  1all things considered a job very well done  1thanks good a movie like this was done and released  1one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  1it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  1the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  1it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  1up there with the best of melville  1everything about this film is simply incredible  1you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  1black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  1the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  1i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  1im not sure what he was trying to do with this film  0if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  0there is a lot of beautiful places  1it was forced like everything in this movie  0again lame  0heres where the movie really pied me off  0and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork  0when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  0summary the witticisms werent witty  0the plot  well i said id let that one go  0the acting was bad  0really bad  0even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse  0camerawork  again bad  0rating 1 out of 10  0an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  1kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  1he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  1his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  1three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen  1and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  1i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  1i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  1i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  110 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  1i literally vomited while watching this film  0i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls  1his performance as awarded was stunning  1the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  1in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  1all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast  1im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  0but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a

excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  1the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  1the characters are

performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  0now this is a movie i really dislike  0its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  0the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks  0the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  0there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  0i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs
